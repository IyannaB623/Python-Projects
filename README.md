# Python-Projects
Projects I have created using Python

## 1. Guess Your Age
:white_small_square: This project takes in a number of your choice between 2-10 and follows with arithmetic instructions to apply to that number.

:white_small_square: After following the instructions you will end up with a 3 or 4 digit number. The first number should be your number of choice and the last number(s) should be your age.

## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
:white_small_square: The traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but you are playing against the computer.

:white_small_square: You first input your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then the computer will generate its choice using random. 

:white_small_square: If statements will compare the two choices to determine the winner. 

:white_small_square: Using a while loop you can make your choice to continue to play and the score variables will count your wins compared to the computer wins.
