Projects I have created using Python

## 1. Guess Your Age
:white_small_square: This project takes in a number of your choice between 2-10 and follows with arithmetic instructions to apply to that number.

:white_small_square: After following the instructions you will end up with a 3 or 4 digit number. The first number should be your number of choice and the last number(s) should be your age.

## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
:white_small_square: The traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but you are playing against the computer.

:white_small_square: You first input your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then the computer will generate its choice using random. 

:white_small_square: If statements will compare the two choices to determine the winner. 

:white_small_square: Using a while loop you can make your choice to continue to play and the score variables will count your wins compared to the computer wins. 

## 3. Strong Passwords

:white_small_square: This program determines if you password is strong or not.

:white_small_square: The function will take in your password as input and check for lowercase letter, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and length.

:white_small_square: If all parameters are met you will receive a score of 5/5 making for a Strong password.

:white_small_square: If you are missing any of the parameters you will receive a score less than 5 with notes on how you can strengthen your password.

:white_small_square: If you would like to enter another password you can make that choice to continue or not with use of the While Loop.
