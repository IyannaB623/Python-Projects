# Python-Projects
In this repository you can find python files of projects I have created solely using Python. Below in this read me you can find the description of each project and how it functions. 

## 1. Guess Your Age
:white_small_square: This project takes in a number of your choice between 2-10 and follows with arithmetic instructions to apply to that number.

:white_small_square: After following the instructions you will end up with a 3 or 4 digit number. The first number should be your number of choice and the last number(s) should be your age.

## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
:white_small_square: The traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but you are playing against the computer.

:white_small_square: You first input your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then the computer will generate its choice using random. 

:white_small_square: If statements will compare the two choices to determine the winner. 

:white_small_square: Using a while loop you can make your choice to continue to play and the score variables will count your wins compared to the computer wins. 

## 3. Strong Passwords

:white_small_square: This program determines if you password is strong or not.

:white_small_square: The function will take in your password as input and check for lowercase letter, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and length.

:white_small_square: If all parameters are met you will receive a score of 5/5 making for a Strong password.

:white_small_square: If you are missing any of the parameters you will receive a score less than 5 with notes on how you can strengthen your password.

:white_small_square: If you would like to enter another password you can make that choice to continue or not with use of the While Loop. 

## 4. Password Generator

:white_small_square: This program will generate a strong password for you with the option of having a fully generated password or one that you can customize. It also serves as a password strength checker if your custom input satisfies all of the requirements to be a strong password.

:white_small_square: The first input will ask if you would like Option 1: Fully Generated or Option 2: custom.

:white_small_square: If Option 1: You will receive an 8 character long password with atleast one number, one uppercase and lowercase letter, and one special character.

:white_small_square: If Option 2: You will recieve a password including your custom input that satisfies all of the strong password requirements as mentioned above.

:white_small_square: In option 2, you can also recieve you custom input back without any changes if it already satisfies all of the requirements as mentioned above.
