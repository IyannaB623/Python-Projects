# Python-Projects
In this repository you can find python files of projects I have created solely using Python. Below in this read me you can find the description of each project and how it functions. 

## 1. Guess Your Age
:white_small_square: This project takes in a number of your choice between 2-10 and follows with arithmetic instructions to apply to that number.

:white_small_square: After following the instructions you will end up with a 3 or 4 digit number. The first number should be your number of choice and the last number(s) should be your age.

## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
:white_small_square: The traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but you are playing against the computer.

:white_small_square: You first input your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then the computer will generate its choice using random. 

:white_small_square: If statements will compare the two choices to determine the winner. 

:white_small_square: Using a while loop you can make your choice to continue to play and the score variables will count your wins compared to the computer wins. 

## 3. Strong Passwords

:white_small_square: This program determines if you password is strong or not.

:white_small_square: The function will take in your password as input and check for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and length.

:white_small_square: If all parameters are met you will receive a score of 5/5 making for a Strong password.

:white_small_square: If you are missing any of the parameters you will receive a score less than 5 with notes on how you can strengthen your password.

:white_small_square: If you would like to enter another password you can make that choice to continue or not with use of the While Loop. 

## 4. Password Generator

:white_small_square: This program will generate a strong password for you with the option of having a fully generated password or one that you can customize. It also serves as a password strength checker if your custom input satisfies all of the requirements to be a strong password.

:white_small_square: The first input will ask if you would like Option 1: Fully Generated or Option 2: custom.

:white_small_square: If Option 1: You will receive an 8 character long password with atleast one number, one uppercase and lowercase letter, and one special character.

:white_small_square: If Option 2: You will recieve a password including your custom input that satisfies all of the strong password requirements as mentioned above.

:white_small_square: Also in Option 2, you can also recieve you custom input back without any changes if it already satisfies all of the requirements as mentioned above. 

:white_small_square: You can continue to generate more passwords by inputting 'Y' for yes, when asked, to restart function. 

## 5. Recipe Madlibs

:white_small_square: This project takes in user input to produce a madlib with the theme of recipes.

:white_small_square: The user will insert any noun, adjectives, verbs, and more that come to mind without seeing the madlib script.

:white_small_square: Then the inputs are stored inside variables to be printed into the script. 

:white_small_square: This makes for a rather entertaining recipe in the end.

## 6. Email Slicer

:white_small_square: Simple email slicer that takes your email address as input then prints your username and domain separately.

## 7. Whats the word?

:white_small_square: Try to guess the word in 10 attemps or less.

:white_small_square: The function using random to choose a random word from the word bank to compare it to the users guess. 

:white_small_square: The function checks to make sure you haven't repeated a word or that your word is five letters long before moving forward.

:white_small_square: The function will return the number of correct letters, correct indexes, and correct letters within the index to help with your next guess. 

:white_small_square: The function also returns the attempts you have left. 

:white_small_square: If you guess within 10 attempts you win, if not you lose and the word will be revealed to you.
