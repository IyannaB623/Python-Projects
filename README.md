# Python-Projects
In this repository you can find python files of projects I have created solely using Python. Below in this read me you can find the description of each project and how it functions. 

## 1. Guess Your Age
:white_small_square: This project takes in a number of your choice between 2-10 and follows with arithmetic instructions to apply to that number.

## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
